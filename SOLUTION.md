# Solution
**Client-Server Integration Report**

### **Overview**

This report details the issues identified in the provided client and server code, the solutions implemented, and how both were aligned for successful communication. The goal was to ensure compatibility between the server and client using the same IP, port, and communication protocol.

---

### **Issues Identified**

#### **Server Code (********`server.rs`********\*\*\*\*):**

1. **Lack of Default Main Functionality**:

   - The original server code did not specify a clear entry point (`main`) for execution.
   - Solution: Added a `main` function to initialize the server on IP `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`. The server now runs in a separate thread for better resource management.

2. **Client Disconnection Handling**:

   - Missing robust handling when the client disconnects.
   - Solution: Improved the `handle` method in the `Client` struct to log disconnections more clearly and stop processing on disconnection.

3. **Non-Blocking Mode for Listener**:

   - Already present but required testing for efficient connection handling.

4. **Improper Shutdown (********`server.stop();`********\*\*\*\*)**:

   - The `server.stop();` function was called outside the server's thread, leading to potential synchronization issues.
   - Solution: Modified the server's `stop` method to be thread-safe and invoked it correctly within the server's thread or using proper signaling mechanisms.

#### **Client Code (********`client.rs`********\*\*\*\*):**

1. **Timeout Configuration**:

   - Timeout handling was present but untested.
   - Solution: Ensured the client properly connects and disconnects within the specified timeout.

2. **Protocol Mismatch**:

   - The `client_message::Message` and `ServerMessage` were not synchronized with the `EchoMessage` used on the server.
   - Solution: Updated the client to use the same `EchoMessage` protocol, ensuring encoding/decoding consistency.

3. **Error Logging**:

   - The client lacked detailed logging for failed message sends or receives.
   - Solution: Enhanced error reporting with explicit logs for debugging.

### **Modifications Made**

#### **Server**:

- Added a `main` function for initializing the server.
- Enhanced the `run` and `handle` methods to improve reliability and debugging logs.
- Fixed potential infinite loops by breaking on unrecoverable errors.
- Ensured proper shutdown by making the `stop` method thread-safe and synchronizing it with the server's lifecycle.

#### **Client**:

- Adjusted the `connect` method to synchronize IP and port with the server.
- Updated `send` and `receive` methods to handle `EchoMessage` for compatibility.
- Improved disconnection logic to gracefully close the connection.

### **Testing and Results**

1. **Server Setup**:

   - The server was run on IP `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`.
   - Verified it could handle multiple client connections sequentially.

2. **Client Interaction**:

   - Successfully connected to the server.
   - Sent and received messages encoded using `EchoMessage`.

3. **Logs Validation**:

   - Both client and server logs showed clear connection, message exchange, and disconnection information.

### **Next Steps**

- Further testing under stress (e.g., multiple clients simultaneously).
- Extending protocol functionality (e.g., additional message types).
- Deployment in a real-world scenario with enhanced error handling.
